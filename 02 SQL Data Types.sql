--SQL Data Types for MySQL, SQL Server, and MS Access
--The data type of a column defines what value the column can hold: integer, character, money, date and time, binary, and so on.

--SQL Data Types
--Each column in a database table is required to have a name and a data type.

--An SQL developer must decide what type of data that will be stored inside each column when creating a table. 
--The data type is a guideline for SQL to understand what type of data is expected inside of each column, and it also identifies how SQL will interact with the stored data.

--Note: Data types might have different names in different database. And even if the name is the same, the size and other details may be different! Always check the documentation!

--MySQL Data Types (Version 8.0)
