--SQL SELECT INTO Statement

/*
The SQL SELECT INTO Statement
The SELECT INTO statement copies data from one table into a new table.

SELECT INTO Syntax
Copy all columns into a new table:

SELECT *
INTO newtable [IN externaldb]
FROM oldtable
WHERE condition;
Copy only some columns into a new table:

SELECT column1, column2, column3, ...
INTO newtable [IN externaldb]
FROM oldtable
WHERE condition;
The new table will be created with the column-names and types as defined in the old table. You can create new column names using the AS clause.

SQL SELECT INTO Examples
The following SQL statement creates a backup copy of Customers:
*/

SELECT *
INTO CustomersBackup2017
FROM Customers;

--The following SQL statement uses the IN clause to copy the table into a new table in another database:
SELECT *
INTO CustomersBackup2017 IN 'Backup.mdb'
FROM Customers;

--The following SQL statement copies only a few columns into a new table:
SELECT *
INTO CustomersGermany
FROM Customers
WHERE Country= 'Germany';

--The following SQL statement copies data from more than one table into a new table:
SELECT c.ContactName, o.OrderID
INTO CustomersOrderBackup2017
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID;

/*
Tip: SELECT INTO can also be used to create a new, empty table using the schema of another. Just add a WHERE clause that causes the query to return no data:

SELECT * INTO newtable
FROM oldtable
WHERE 1 = 0;
